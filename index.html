    <p>
      I have been taking technology and coding classes since elementary school,
      but I have studied most recently in Windward School's Introduction to
      Programming 8th Period class, taught by Austin Totty. In this class, my
      programming horizons have been broadened greatly, and I have been given
      the opportunity to learn both Java script and HTML. I enjoy STEAM of all
      types and I took this class hoping to give my computer skills basic
      fundamentals in order to progress further in similar fields, such as
      engineering.
